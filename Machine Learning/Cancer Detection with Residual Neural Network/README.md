## Description

This project attempts to train a residual neural network from the PatchCamelyon dataset to identify whether cancer is present. The model's current accuracy on the test set is around 86%.

## To start

Download the following data from https://github.com/basveeling/pcam

camelyonpatch_level_2_split_train_x.h5

camelyonpatch_level_2_split_train_y.h5

camelyonpatch_level_2_split_valid_x.h5

camelyonpatch_level_2_split_valid_y.h5

camelyonpatch_level_2_split_test_x.h5

camelyonpatch_level_2_split_test_y.h5

and place them into a new folder "raw data", then run through the notebook "Cancer Detection with Residual Neural Network.ipynb".
